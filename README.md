# DL_Final_Project_RL

## Team Members:
- Benjamin PHAN
- Adrien AUDREN

## Overview:
In this project, we utilized Reinforcement Learning techniques and implemented the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to train an agent for playing Super Mario Land.

## Modes:
- **CONTINUE:** Resumes training from the last checkpoint.
- **NEW:** Erases previous training and starts fresh.

## How to Train:
### On Your Computer:
- Run `MarioLandMain.py` to initiate training on your local machine.

### On Colab:
- Import and run `MarioLandMainColab.ipynb` on Google Colab for training.

## Settings:
- **AUTOSHUTDOWN:** When set to true, the computer shuts down automatically at the end of the training.
- **disable_renderer:** Disables the visualization of the game if set to true.
- **disable_visualization:** Turns off visualization of the training curve and current actions if set to true.

## Instructions:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set the desired mode (CONTINUE or NEW) and adjust settings if necessary.
3. Run the appropriate file (`MarioLandMain.py` for local training or `MarioLandMainColab.ipynb` for Colab).
4. Monitor training progress and results.
